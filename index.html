        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
            The purpose of this website is to allow programmers to have practice with debugging code.
            It is not intended for anyone learning general programming. Sample codes would be
            provided with some errors for you to try to debug. The code will be in Python language.
        </p>

        <h1>Why Python?</h1>
        <p>
            This website is intended to help any programmer with their debugging skills. Although
            supporting different languages would be great, it will take a lot of time and effort
            to implement that. Since Python is one of the easiest languages to learn, it would be much
            easier to just use python.
        </p>

        <h1>How to Get Started</h1>
        <ol>

                If you are not familiar with Python, the Learn Python Basics page provides a quick lesson
                on the basics of Python. It'll teach how to create variables, if statements, loops, methods,
                classes, etc.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                To start practicing, go to the Practice page. Then, choose which practice problem to do.
                After you think you have figured it out, you can check for the answer underneath the sample code.<br><br>
            </li>

                If you would like to give any feedback, the Feedback page allows you to comment
                on what you like, what you don't like, and how it can be improved.<br><br>

            <li>
                Keep practicing!
